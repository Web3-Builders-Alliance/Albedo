## Problem Statement
### Limitations of Centralized Data Marketplaces
Centralized data storage and verification methods raise concerns about data integrity and security.

### Lack of Trustworthy Escrow Mechanisms
Traditional escrow services are often costly, slow, and opaque, lacking real-time verifiability.
